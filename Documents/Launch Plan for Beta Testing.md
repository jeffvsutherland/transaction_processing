### **Launch Plan for Beta Testing:**

#### **1. Identify and Recruit 10 Beta Users**

- **Target Users:** Look for users who have multiple employers, use several banks, and need frequent expense reports. These could be small business owners, contractors, or employees managing expense reports across multiple employers.
- User Selection Criteria:
  - Must be familiar with Dropbox or willing to use it.
  - Comfortable working with CSV files (bank statements) and configuring an AI tool.
  - Willing to provide detailed feedback on the product.

#### **2. Provide Access to One Second Expense Reports**

- Access GPT Interface:
  - Use the GPT to guide users through the setup of configuration files, primarily focusing on categorizing transactions, setting employer rules, and customizing preferences for the AI-powered rules engine.
  - Ensure users can interact with the Expense.GPT module to set up their personal configuration files (`config.json`, `categories.json`).
- User Onboarding Process:
  - Provide each beta user with step-by-step guidance on creating a Dropbox folder structure to store bank CSV files, config files, and generated expense reports.
  - Ensure that each user creates folders:
    - `/QuickAIReports/BankStatements/` – for uploading bank CSV files.
    - `/QuickAIReports/Setup/` – for config files generated by the GPT.
    - `/QuickAIReports/ExpenseReports/` – for storing the final expense reports.

#### **3. Securely Collect Files**

- Dropbox Integration

  :

  - Instruct users to **store files locally in Dropbox** and share access with your team using a shared folder.
  - Ensure users follow naming conventions and proper folder structure to maintain organization.
  - Example structure:
    - `/QuickAIReports/BankStatements/` (for bank CSV files)
    - `/QuickAIReports/Setup/` (for config files)
    - `/QuickAIReports/ExpenseReports/` (for reports)

- Access Sharing:

  - Users can securely share the Dropbox folder with the QuickAIReports team (e.g., **[support@quickaireports.com](mailto:support@quickaireports.com)**), allowing your team’s Python programs to access these files remotely.

- Security Protocol:

  - Files will be stored with encryption, and only the shared folders will be accessible to your team, maintaining the privacy and security of financial data.
  - Users will be informed about Dropbox's encryption standards to assure them of data protection.

#### **4. Automate the Python Processing**

- Once the user has shared the folder, the Python programs

   will automatically:

  - Fetch the bank CSV files from the `/BankStatements/` folder.
  - Use the `/Setup/config.json` and `/categories.json` files to apply custom rules to categorize the transactions.
  - Generate **audit-ready expense reports** and store them in `/ExpenseReports/`.

- Error Handling and Testing:

  - Ensure that any unrecognized transactions are flagged for user confirmation, allowing them to fine-tune their configuration files as needed.

#### **5. Feedback and Iteration**

- **Regular Check-Ins:** Schedule weekly feedback sessions with beta users to gather insights on their experience with setup, data sharing, and accuracy of expense reports.
- **Monitor Usage Scenarios:** Track different use cases such as multi-company support, custom rules, and changes in bank CSV formats.
- **Iterate and Update:** Based on feedback, update the product’s AI rules engine and user interface to improve functionality and reduce friction points.

### **Key Considerations:**

- **Data Privacy:** Ensure end-to-end encryption for all files, and remind users that Dropbox itself offers strong encryption to protect their data.
- **Seamless Sharing:** Emphasize that Dropbox sharing is a simple and secure way for users to upload files without needing to access a third-party website or worry about file loss.
- **Minimizing Manual Input:** As the AI learns from initial configurations and shared files, the goal is to reduce user interaction over time, leaving the process nearly fully automated.

By using Dropbox, your Python automation, and regular feedback from beta testers, this method will ensure a smooth and secure beta launch.
